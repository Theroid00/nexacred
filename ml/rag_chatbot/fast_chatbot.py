1. **Registration Process**: Both lenders and borrowers must register on SEBI-registered P2P platforms with KYC documentation.

2. **Risk Assessment**: Platforms conduct credit scoring and risk assessment for borrowers using algorithms and credit bureau data.

3. **Loan Listing**: Borrowers create loan requests with purpose, amount (max ₹10 lakhs), and proposed interest rates.

4. **Matching**: Lenders browse loan requests and choose to fund partially or fully based on risk appetite.

5. **Documentation**: Legal loan agreements are created automatically by the platform.

6. **Fund Transfer**: Money flows through escrow accounts maintained with scheduled commercial banks.

7. **Repayment**: Borrowers repay through EMIs, and platforms handle collection and distribution to lenders.

8. **Default Handling**: Platforms have recovery mechanisms, but lenders bear the credit risk.""",

2. **Credit Utilization (30% impact)**:

   - Spread purchases across multiple cards if needed

3. **Credit History Length (15% impact)**:

4. **Credit Mix (10% impact)**:
   - Have a healthy mix of secured and unsecured loans
   - Include credit cards, personal loans, and home loans

5. **New Credit Inquiries (10% impact)**:
